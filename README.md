<h1>What is Selenium?</h1>
Selenium is a free, open-source automation testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms. It is somewhat similar to HP QuickTest Pro (QTP, currently UFT). However, Selenium focuses on automating web-based applications.
Testing done using Selenium is usually referred to as Selenium testing. Remember, only testing web applications is possible with Selenium. You cannot use it to test desktop applications or mobile applications.
